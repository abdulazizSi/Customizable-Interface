# Customizable Interface with UICollectionView in Swift

This project demonstrates the creation of a robust, high-performance layout in Swift, leveraging UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout and UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource. The implementation is inspired by the design of the pazarama app. It showcases the various sections on the home page, including MenuSection, PromotedSection, OffersSection, and StoresSection. These sections are designed to remain static.

However, the dynamic sections, such as ProductsSection and BannersSection, allow for the addition of multiple items from a JSON file or a backend in a real-world scenario. This flexibility makes the app adaptable to various content requirements without compromising performance or user experience and by only using one UICollectionView.

## Features
- Programatic UI
- MVVM
- UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout
- UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource
- Supplementary Views (Header + Footer)
